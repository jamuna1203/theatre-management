# theatre-management
This is a user-friendly and menu-driven program which is designed to book tickets for a movie by a user by providing the necessary details.
When the program is executed, the welcome screen appears showing the logo of the theatre’s name and then shows the option to enter as an admin or a user. 
The admin menu is only accessible after entering the right username and password combination within 3 chances. 
The admin module has 6 options:
  Initialise tickets 
  Movies Running 
  Modify Movies 
  Settings 
  See bookings as admin 
  Exit as admin 
The “Modify Movies” has a menu of adding movies, deleting current movies and editing the current movie details. The option “Settings” deals with customizing the background colour and text colour. 
The user menu has a simple menu containing the options:
  Book a Movie 
  Modify a Booking 
  Cancel a Booking 
  Exit as User 
When the “Book a Movie” option is selected, the list of all movies running in the theatre is shown. The user has to select a movie and then enter his/her details like name, age, number of tickers to be booked and contact details. The total fare is calculated and is shown along with the main ticket number.
